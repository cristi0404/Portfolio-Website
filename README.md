# Portfolio-Website
This is the code for my personal website.

## Local Development

1. Get the http-server installed on you Mac by running (if brew is not install it, install it)
```bash
brew install http-server
```
2. Start the server (you need to be in root of the project):
```bash
http-server -p 8080 -a 0.0.0.0 -c-1
```

3. Read the output of server start, it will tell you where to go :)
