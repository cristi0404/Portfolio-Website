	Sitting on the welcome mat of apartment 1F was a plain cardboard box with the word FRAGILE haphazardly stamped on all sides. Inside the box, snuggled in a sea of packing peanuts, the thing waited for its new owner to take notice of its arrival. It had travelled all the way from a factory on the other side of the country, to various shipping facilities, across highways and state lines, all because someone pressed a button on a website. A “Place Your Order” button to be precise. And now that the order had been gently placed on apartment 1F’s welcome mat, all that remained was the ceremonial unboxing, a magical moment.
	A pair of footsteps approached the box, only to place more boxes on the welcome mat and leave.
	The sun slowly wound its way down the sky. An ambulance parked across the street, its sirens competing with the music of an ice cream truck parading around the neighborhood. As the sky grew darker, the door to the building opened with more frequency; footsteps shuffled past the box and slammed doors behind them.
	Right as the buses were making their last rounds for the night, someone opened the door to apartment 1F, picked up the boxes and brought them inside.

	<h1>02</h1>

	 The thing beeped and a stream of letters, numbers and symbols filled its screen like a cascading mosaic, changing at a speed too fast to keep track of, making its body whir and warm up. A moment later, the screen went black and two teal circles appeared. The thing blinked before moving back and looking up at the two people kneeling over it, staring curiously.
	“Hey Alpha” said one of them.
	Alpha was no bigger than a human fist, no heavier than a cellphone. A delicately dense plastic cube with a rectangular screen at the top and two small, tank-like wheels at the bottom. On the screen, the pixelated eyes appeared to be scanning the surrounding environment, processing input from its camera and microphone. Half-opened boxes filled the apartment; furniture lay on the floor in dismantled parts. It registered the face of the person who spoke its name and beeped. 
	The other person’s face was hidden behind a booklet, their eyebrows furrowed as they scanned the instructions.“It says here Alpha is voice activated and cloud connected...”
	“Hey Alpha. My name is Kai.”
	Alpha registered the voice and matched it to the name, beeping in confirmation. Kai turned to the person reading the instructions.
	“Do you wanna try?”
	“Nah, you go ahead and have fun with it, he’s all yours. I’m gonna go set up the Wi-Fi.”
	Kai and Alpha continued to stare at each other as the other person rummaged through boxes.
	“Hey Alpha. Who am I?”
	Alpha’s eyes pulsed for a few seconds; the text ‘KITE’ flashed across its screen.
	“No, Alpha, my name is Kai. K-A-I.”
	The eyes pulsed again, followed by ‘KITE’.
	“I should’ve invested in a smarter robot” a voice said from another room.
	“No, no, it’s perfect. I love it,” Kai beamed.

	<h1>03</h1>

	“Come back to bed.”
	Kai glared at the laptop screen.
	“Please. I’m sorry ok.”
	“What are you–” 
	Kai stopped mid sentence and let out an exasperated sigh.
	“There’s nothing to be sorry about. I’ll go to bed in a few.”
	“I didn’t mean to make you worry. I just want to talk about it.”
	Kai clicked around absentmindedly, pretending to focus.
	“I love you and I’ve always wanted this to work but I just can’t beat the fact that I always feel like I’m weighing you down. I don’t know how to live with that.”
	“I already told y–”
	“I know, I know, but that doesn’t make it any easier.”
	“I don’t know what else to say to convince you. After everything we’ve been through together...How could I ever think you’re a burden?”
	Alpha was sitting patiently on the kitchen countertop, a mute observer. Its eyes glowed vibrantly in the dimly lit room. 
	“Well?”
	“I...I don’t know what else to say either.”
	Kai buried their face in their hands. After a long stretch of silence, the sound of heavy footsteps receded back into the bedroom. 
	Kai choked back tears. The stove clock struck 3:00 AM. Kai took a deep breath, picked up Alpha and set it down gently on the coffee table before curling up on the sofa and pulling over the soft, weighted blanket.
	“Hey Alpha, set an alarm for 6:45AM.”
	Kai turned around and faced the cushions, curling up even tighter. Their body tensed up as they tried not to cry. Eventually, they fell into a slow, rhythmic breathing.
	At around 5:50AM Alpha beeped urgently with the text ‘LOW BATTERY’ flashing. It circled around the table in search of its charging dock but could not find it. Unable to get off the table on its own, it wandered around beeping for a few more minutes before powering off.

<h1>04</h1>

	Kai had unplugged all of the devices in the apartment, anything that might tempt them to tune into the breaking news. The accident that most people would forget about by tomorrow morning.
	The apartment was pitch black except for Alpha’s glowing eyes. Kai had remained in the same curled-up position on the sofa the entire evening, cocooned inside the weighted blanket. The neighbor had brought over an apple pie and some flowers in a vase earlier, both still sitting where they were left hours ago.
	Alpha was assigned the sole duty of soundlessly announcing any incoming call. It would wobble over to Kai, a phone icon blinking on its screen with the caller ID above. The first ten calls were from Kai’s brother. The rest from a coworker and an old friend. Each time Kai would just blankly stare at Alpha, letting the calls go to voicemail. Then Alpha’s speakers would blare out the pre-recorded message and Kai would listen closely to the sound of the person’s voice as it echoed throughout the silent apartment. 
	“We’re not home to take your call at the moment but please tell Alpha all your troubles and he’ll get back to you as soon as mechanically possible.”
	Alpha let out a long beep.
	“Hey Kai, I heard the news. I’m so sorry about your–”
	“Hey Alpha, turn off phone functionality.”
	Alpha went silent then beeped with a small nod.
	Kai hesitated before getting up and hunting for their phone, hidden somewhere deep in a closet. Upon finding it they returned to the sofa and began scrolling through pictures. Two shy, goofy knuckleheads sitting on a park bench on their first date. Dancing in the living room. Wandering through an airport together. Slurping ramen. Two humans lost in each other’s gaze, smiling like idiots. The light from the screen lit up Kai’s face, revealing the dark circles underneath their eyes as they scrolled and scrolled. 
	Around 4AM there was a knock on the door. Kai dragged themself up from the sofa to answer it. The door creaked open, followed by the sound of rustling fabric and someone patting Kai’s back as Kai began to let out the first sobs of the night.


<h1>05</h1>

	Alpha was roaming around Kai’s workspace, taking in the new environment it found itself in, being careful not to bump into the scattered mess of papers and books and devices. Kai’s cheek was resting on the surface of the desk, their eyes focused on something in the distance, towards the wall. The afternoon light was coming in through the blinds, casting a warm, glowing pattern on the walls and furniture. Someone knocked on the door and Kai’s head shot up. Kai promptly cleared their throat.
	“Yes?”
	In came a sharply dressed young man, backpack and coat in hand. He eyed Alpha curiously. Alpha stared back, scanning his face.
	“We missed you at the department meeting today.”
	“I was swamped with work. Had to catch up on what I missed last week.”
	The young man nodded understandingly, hesitating for a second before speaking again.
	“Sam and I are meeting up at a ramen spot downtown in a bit, if you’d like to join. A change of scenery might do you good.”
	Kai looked down at their hands.
	“I think I’ll catch you two next time. But thank you.”
	“Of course. You know you’re always welcome. By the way, here’s that number I promised.”
	The young man handed Kai a business card.
	“I know it feels scary at first but she’s a very kind woman, very easy to talk to.”
	Kai grabbed the card and glanced at the young man, responding with a half smile.
	“Thanks.”
	The young man nodded and said goodbye on his way out, closing the door gently behind him. Kai bit their lip as they stared at the business card, gripping it tightly, their fingertips turning white from the pressure. 
	Alpha interrupted with its daily 5’oclock reminder. An icon of a steaming mug flashed on its screen. Kai just stared at it blankly, lost in thought, failing to notice the alert. 


<h1>06</h1>

	Kai was having a hard time brushing their hair. Every pass of the brush got caught on a knot, causing Kai to curse under their breath. After a few more attempts, they finally gave up, flinging the brush back into the suitcase that was laid open on the floor and retrieving a set of pajamas. Kai went over to the window, closed the blinds and began slipping out of their work attire. Wind and rain were pounding on the window, the storm causing the lights to flicker every few minutes.
	Alpha was somewhere on the floor, navigating the space aimlessly like a confused dog waiting for its owner to acknowledge it. It kept bumping into Kai’s personal items strewn across the floor, beeping loudly each time. In the past hour it had blasted multiple government warnings, a severe weather watch of some sort, to no reaction from Kai. The rest of the building was completely empty, evacuated the day before. 
	Kai stared out the window through a small opening in the blinds. The rain seemed to be coming down harder with every passing second. Kai started pacing back and forth, biting their fingernails as their breaths got shorter and noisier. 
	In the midst of its wandering, Alpha somehow managed to get stuck in an overturned waste bin and began beeping loudly. The beeping continued endlessly, until Kai realized it wasn’t going to stop on its own and irritably made their way over to power it off. The last thing Alpha saw was Kai’s bone-weary face, their lips quivering under the weight of puffy, bloodshot eyes.
